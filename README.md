# Hanzi-Workbook
Java Swing GUI to annotate a Hanzi Workbook (Specifically: McNaughton, W. and Fan, J. (Year) Reading and Writing Chinese: Third Edition, HSK All Levels (2,349 Chinese Characters and 5,000+ Compounds). 3rd ed. [Tuttle Publishing]. ISBN 9780804842990.)

Obviously for legal reasons, you have to source an ebook version yourself. Once you do, use the python script and then delete the bad pages (Good ones should be page_26.png -> page_298.png)

<pre> pip install pdf2image </pre>

<pre> javac HanziWorkbook.java </pre>

<pre> java HanziWorkbook </pre>
